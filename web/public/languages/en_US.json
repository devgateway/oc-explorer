Through a red flagging approach (highlighting procurement activities that have certain risk factors), this prototype explores corruption risk through the visualization of 10 indicators that are mapped to three different forms of corruption: fraud, collusion, and process rigging. Users are free to explore the data, which has been converted to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), using a variety of filters. A crosstab table enables users to explore the overlap between any two indicators that are mapped to the same risk type.",
