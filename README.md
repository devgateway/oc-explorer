# Open Contracting Explorer (OCE)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/devgateway/ocvn.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/devgateway/ocvn)

## Presentation

OCVN is a project that allows importing the Vietnam public procurement data, available in the common MS Excel format, into a native [Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS)](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) NoSQL storage, and then run visual data analytics (display a *live* dashboard with charts, maps and data tables as well as custom comparison charts). Since the data is natively stored in the OCDS format, it can be readily exported in this format without any transformation required, and with great throughput. 

Find out more about the OCVN goals [here](http://www.developmentgateway.org/2015/11/12/open-contracting-vietnam/).

The project uses open source technologies exclusively, with the following list of key components:

- [Spring Framework](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) - for security, service oriented architecture and REST API.
- [JPA persistence](http://hibernate.org/orm/) for temporarily storing and organizing the MS Excel Files containing the raw data.
- [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) for reading the native MS Excel input dataset.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - as the native OCDS NoSQL datastore. We have implemented the whole OCDS 1.0 standard schema and all data used in analytics/maps as well as raw OCDS export is stored directly into this format in MongoDB. 
- [Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) - for the admin interface that runs the upload/import process of raw data
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - for integrating the dashboard/map/filter technologies
- [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly/) - as the chart library
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) - as the map library

## Architecture

This is a mavenized multi-module project. It is built on the open source [dg-toolkit](https://github.com/devgateway/dg-toolkit) architecture. Each module can be started independently of the rest. All modules are based on [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) templates.

The project uses [the gitflow workflow](https://github.com/devgateway/ocvn/blob/develop/gitflow.md) to drive the software release process.

### Modules

- [persistence](https://github.com/devgateway/ocvn/tree/master/persistence) - this is a module responsible with [JPA 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API) data persistence. It is also provides [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) services on top of the existing entities.
 
- [persistence-mongodb](https://github.com/devgateway/ocvn/tree/master/persistence-mongodb) - this is a module responsible with Spring Data MongoDB access. It stores the MongoDB DAO and MongoDB Template configuration files.

- [web](https://github.com/devgateway/ocvn/tree/master/web) - this module provides REST endpoints for the services needed, as well as basic security. It depends on the **persistence** module.

- [forms](https://github.com/devgateway/ocvn/tree/master/forms) - this module provides a basic toolkit for quickly building forms over the entities defined in the persistence module. It uses [Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) as the backend.

- [ui](https://github.com/devgateway/ocvn/tree/master/ui) - this module is a template for building front-end functionality. It is supposed to work in conjunction with the **web** module as the back-end. It is based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [NuclearJS](https://optimizely.github.io/nuclear-js/). The Maven build integration is assured by [frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) which invokes [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). The UI module can be used by both UI developers, with no need of knowledge or Java/Maven local setup and by the back-end developers, with no need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed on their system.

### Building

As prerequisites, we need Java 8 and Maven 3.3.x.
In order to build the project, invoke:

```
mvn install
```

isnide the root project folder.

### Debugging

You can import dg-toolkit as a Maven project inside your favorite IDE, it should work in IDEA/STS/Eclipse but you will need Maven 3.3.x.

## Debugging in STS

Since all the modules are Spring Boot, debugging in STS is really easy. In Spring Boot 1.3 and later there is something called [spring-boot-devtools](https://spring.io/blog/2015/06/17/devtools-in-spring-boot-1-3).
This dependency is already included in the pom.xml of the modules, uncomment it if you plan to use it. If you do, then in STS you can do Debug As->Spring DevTools Client.

If you have JRebel license, then don't use spring-boot-devtools. Best is to start the modules by invoking Debug As->Spring Boot App

### Debugging fat jars

[Fat jars](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-build.html) are the way to go when it comes to java micro-services these days. While the pre-built maven project can be easily debugged as described above, a already packaged jar requires remote debugging. You can start the fat jar with remote debugging parameters by invoking:

`java -Xverify:none -noverify -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -jar fat.jar`

... And then for example in STS you can add a new Debug Configuration->Remote Java Application and specify localhost and port 5005.
